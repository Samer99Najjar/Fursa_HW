In this homework we are asked to implement 3 basic bash scripts.
The file of the homework is found in the files. Where you can also find the scripts themselves.
Activating the scripts is pretty simple all you have to do is download them press on them and just follow the instructions and putting in the correct input.

The first Script we were asked to read 2 numbers from the user sum them up
and then write on the screen if they were greater/equal/less than 100
